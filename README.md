# Real-time-YouTube-Captions-to-Sign-Language-Animation
This project captures YouTube captions and converts them to sign language animations in real-time. It uses a browser extension to capture video captions, which are processed by a Django backend to render animations. The goal is to provide real-time sign language translations for the hearing-impaired community.
